the overall intent of this slash-command is to enforce an elegant (concept of a) workflow: main Claude acts as an orchestrater for specific subagents with specific roles. `agentmain`-x(`agentplan`), {`agentmain`-y(`typescript-craftsman`&`typescript-test-architect`), `agentmain`-z*(`typescript-code-reviewer`&`ts-test-runner`)} do while(either report fails); `agentmain`-`gitops(push)` with y >z, not strictly, but ideally to give the reviewers broader context and catch errors created by the parallel impl and not complete incinerate tokens
